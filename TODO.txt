game rules
- check and checkmate
- endgame states
-- checkmate
-- resign

- promotion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Pawn_promotion)
- castling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Castling)

optional stuff
- timer mode
- player naming (refactor nextTurn() to make turn labels player-set)
- checkers (the code is generalized enough to make it relatively easy...)
- sandbox/godmode (spawn units, make one side checkers and one side chess, ...)
- simple 2nd player AI (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/, at least down to alpha-beta pruning)

GUI stuff
- proper GUI (non-ASCII)
- graphics
